Basic Visual Elements:

1.Single pulsing circle centered on screen

2.Color controlled by horizontal mouse position

3.Smooth size animation using sine wave


Inspiration:
I was thinking of creating an audio related to pattern size. When you move your mouse, it will change the size of the pattern, which also changes the audio.

The circle will continuously pulse while generating musical tones when it reaches its largest size. The piece creates an interactive relationship between position, color, and sound while maintaining minimal code complexity.
